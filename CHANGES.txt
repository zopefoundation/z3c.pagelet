1.2.2 (2011-08-18)
------------------

- Change request interface in pagelet adapter signature e.g.
  (context, request, pagelet). Switch from IBrowserRequest to IHTTPRequest.
  This allows to use the pagelet pattern for jsonrpc request which doesn't
  provide IBrowserRequest. Also reflect the changes in configure.zcml


1.2.1 (2010-07-29)
------------------

- ``zope.app.pagetemplate.metaconfigure.registerType`` was moved to
  ``zope.browserpage``, so it gets now imported from there.

- Dropped test dependency on ``zope.app.security``, it is no longer
  needed.

- Using python's ``doctest`` instead of deprecated
  ``zope.testing.doctest[unit]``.


1.2.0 (2009-08-27)
------------------

- Fix untrusted redirect to google.com in tests. It's now forbidden by default
  by newer zope.publisher versions.

- Change ``zope.app.publisher`` dependency to new ``zope.browserpage``, as it
  has much less dependencies.

1.1.0 (2009-05-28)
------------------

* Got rid of dependency on ``zope.app.component`` by requiring
  ``zope.component >= 3.7``.

* Removed hard dependency on ``zope.formlib``: the pagelet forms now
  only get defined when ``zope.formlib`` is available. Tests still
  depend on ``zope.formlib``, so it got a test dependency.

* Made sure long_description renders fine on pypi.


1.0.3 (2009-02-27)
------------------

* Allow use of ``z3c.pt`` using ``z3c.ptcompat`` compatibility layer.

* Add support for context-specific layout and content template lookup,
  using (view, request, context) discriminator. This is compatible with
  context-specific templates introduced in z3c.template 1.2.0.

* Don't do rendering in pagelet's __call__ method when request is a redirection.

* Add sphinx-based HTML documentation building part to the buildout.


1.0.2 (2008-01-21)
------------------

* Added a `form.zcml` which can be included to have a template for
  ``PageletAddForm``, ``PageletEditForm`` and ``PageletDisplayForm``.


1.0.1 (2007-10-08)
------------------

* Added ``update()`` and ``render()`` method to ``IPagelet`` which was
  not specified but used.

* Fixed a infinite recursion bug when a layout template was registered for "*"
  but no content template was registered for a pagelet.
